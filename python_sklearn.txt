- Text mining
  - sklearn.feature_extraction.text
    - CountVectorizer/TfidfVectorizer - some key functions 
      - fit(): return paramaters in text mining they are like word occurences and 
        store them in internal states.
      - transform: call a defined function to the raw data to form a tranining data
      - fit_transform(): combine with fit() and transform()
      - CountVectorizer().vocabulary_: return terms and their mapping indices.
      - tranform().toarray(): depending on how many rows of words input, returns an
        array that represent the number of occurences baesd on the 
        CountVectorizer().vocabulary_.keys() and display the occurrences number in
        the length of row.
