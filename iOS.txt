// Some APIs

* UIBeizer: 

* CG - Core Graphic framework

* AutoLayout
    - AutoLayout in code is actually a equality that shows the relationship amoung objects
    - Auto Layout Attributes

                       Bottom
    - For example
      The formaluar is item1.attribute = Multiplier * item2.attribute + Constant
      The goal is to provide a series of equations that have one and only one possible
      solution.
      we have two boxes placed side by side
      then we the following equalities

      // Vertical Constraints
      red.top = 1.0 * superview.top + 20.0
      superview.bottom = 1.0 * red.bottom + 20.0
      blue.top = 1.0 * superview + 20.0
      superview.bottom = 1.0 * blue.bottom + 20.0

      // Horizontal Constrains
      red.leading = 1.0 * superview.leading + 20.0
      blue.leading = 1.0 * red.trailing + 8.0
      superview.trailing = 1.0 * blue.trailing + 20.0
      red.width = 1.0 blue.width.0.0

      // Equations above provide nonambiugous and ....solution

    - layout attributes are defined in NSLayoutConstraint class:
        - NSLayoutAttribute.left...
    - to create a constraint in code we use its initializer
        - NSLayoutConstraint(item, attribute, relatedBy, toItem, attribute, multiplier, constant)

* View and Control
  - UISegmentedControl
    - A horizontal control made of multiple segments, each segment functioning as dis
      crete button

* View Controller Lifecycle
  - order of execution
    - Instantiated (from storyboard usually)
    - awakeFromNib (Only if instantiated from a storyboard)
    - aegue preparation
    - outlets get set
    - viewDidLoad()
    - viewWillAppear() and viewDidAppear()
    - viewWillDisappear() and viewDidDisappear()
    - viewWillLayoutSubviews() and viewDidLayoutSubviews() happens for "geometry chaged
    - didReciveMemoryWarnning()
