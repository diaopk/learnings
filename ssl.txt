Certificate. When you choose to activate SSL on your web server you will be
promoteed to complete a number of questions about the identity of your 
websites and your company. Your web server then creates two crytographic 
keys a private and a public key.

Signing Request(CSR) -  a data file also containing your details. You should
then submit the CSR. During the SSL Certificate application process, the 
certificate authority will validate your datails and issue an SSL 
certificate containing your details and allowing you ro use SSL. Your web 
server wil match your issued SSL certificate to your private key. Your web 
server then be able to establish an encrypted link bewteen the website and
