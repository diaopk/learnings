* Methods
    - GET : The GET method requests a representation of the specified
      resource. Requestes using GET should only retrieve data and
      should have no effect.

    - HEAD
      The HEAD method asks for a response identical to that of a GET
      request, but without the response body. This is useful for 
      retrieving meta-information written in response headers, without
      having to transport the entire content

    - POST
      The POST method request that the server accept the entity 
      enclosed in the request as a new subordinate of the web resource;

    - PUT
      The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under 
      the supplied URI. If the URI refers to an already existing 
      resource, then the server can create the resource with that URI

    - DELETE
      The DELETE method deletes the specified resourece
    
    - TRACE
         The TRACE method echoes the received request to that a client can
         see what changes or additions have been made by intermediate server

    - OPTIONS
      The OPTIONS method returns the HTTP methods that the server 
      support for the specified URL. This can be used to check the
      functionality of a web server by requesting '*' instead of a
      specific resource

    - CONNECT
      The CONNECT method converts the request connection to a 
      transparent TCP/IP tunnel, usually to facilitate SSL-encrypted 
      communication(HTTPS) through an unencrypted HHTP proxy.

    - PATCH
      The PATCH method applies partial modifications to a resource
